# SOURCE CONTROL

This project uses the sapling (sl) source control system, with commands like:
- sl status: shows the list of files that have changed
- sl diff: renders all the changes in patch format
- sl commit -m "title": records a commit with all the changes
- sl amend: amends the top commit


# BEST PRACTICES

- Always check and lint the edited files before declaring a task done
- Always offer to create a commit before declaring a task done
- Always make sure that testing and deployment are reproducible before declaring a task done
